🔍 Line Follower Robot (PID-Based)
This project showcases a basic yet effective line follower robot using minimal components and the power of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface with smooth turns and precision, making it a great introduction to robotics and control systems.

🛠️ Components Used
Acrylic chassis 🚗 for the body

L293D Motor Shield 💡 for motor control

Arduino Uno 🧠 as the microcontroller

Li-ion battery 🔋 as the power source

Power switch to toggle the system

These components were selected for their availability, affordability, and simplicity for beginner-friendly builds.

🧮 PID Algorithm in Action
The heart of this project lies in the PID algorithm, which adjusts the motor speeds based on the position of the robot relative to the line. The sensor readings are converted into error values, and the PID logic ensures that the robot corrects its path dynamically. This results in smoother movement, fewer jerks, and better stability even on curves.

💻 Arduino Programming
The robot is programmed using standard Arduino IDE. The code reads sensor inputs, calculates PID terms (P, I, and D), and adjusts the motor speeds accordingly using PWM signals. The use of PID makes the robot much more responsive and accurate compared to basic if-else logic-based followers.

🚀 Final Output
Once powered on, the robot detects the black line and follows it with great stability. It adjusts speed and direction as per the PID control, showing consistent performance. This project is a fun and rewarding way to learn about control algorithms, embedded programming, and basic electronics!
