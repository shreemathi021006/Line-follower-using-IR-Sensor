# Line-follower-using-IR-Sensor
I built a line follower using an acrylic chassis 🚗, L293D motor shield 💡, Arduino Uno 🧠, switch, and Li-ion battery 🔋. Coded with Arduino using PID algorithm 🧮, it smoothly followed the black line 🖤 with accurate turns and speed control. Simple setup, smart performance! 😍
